//! Handing a link to the platform.
//!
//! A URL, an e-mail address or an OSC 8 URI the pointer opened goes to
//! whatever the desktop opens such things with: `xdg-open` on Linux and the
//! BSDs, `open` on macOS, the shell's URL handler on Windows. The terminal
//! neither knows nor asks which browser that is, and the link travels as one
//! argument, never through a shell.
//!
//! One [`Opener`] per window, on the [`crate::settings::SettingsApp`] model:
//! the children it started are held until the next request reaps them, so a
//! hundred links opened over a week leave no zombie behind, and a failure to
//! start is one line in the log rather than a notice on the glass.
//!
//! A headless surface gets the recording form, which keeps the last link it
//! was handed and starts nothing: what the pointer tests read back.
