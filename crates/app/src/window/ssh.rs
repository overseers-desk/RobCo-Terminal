//! Opening an SSH connection, and opening another channel on one already
//! standing.
//!
//! Everything a connection needs from the window is here: the grid to size
//! the remote pty to, the `TERM` the session config advertises, and the bank
//! the model raises for it. The policy is [`crate::ssh`]'s and the transport
//! is `ssh_link`'s; neither is restated.
//!
//! Fields touched: `channels`, which raises the bank and holds the rows;
//! `banks`, whose record takes the `Link` (dropping it is the disconnect)
//! and the `AskDesk` the connection asks its questions over; `viewport` and
//! `session_config`, which size and name the remote pty.
