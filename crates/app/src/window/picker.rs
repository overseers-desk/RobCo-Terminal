//! The destination picker's lifecycle: raising it on a free home slot,
//! painting its page, reading its keys and taking it down again.
//!
//! The page itself is [`crate::picker`], which is pure state over keystrokes
//! and a painter that turns it into bytes. What is here is everything that
//! needs the window: a channel to paint into, a connection to dial, and the
//! config file to write a chosen default to.
//!
//! Fields touched: `picker`, the page while it stands; `channels`, whose
//! free home slot carries it; `viewport` and `session_config`, which size
//! and configure that carrier; and `settings`, the only handle in the
//! program that writes `ssh.default`.
