//! The bank's state half: which slots the engraved numerals name right now.
//!
//! The measures are `chassis::bank`'s and the strips' shape is
//! `chassis::strip`'s; what is here is the paging, which is channel state and
//! belongs with the channel state machines, exactly as `chassis::bank`'s
//! module doc says.
//!
//! The rows are a fixed-size window onto the slot space, paged: the numerals
//! read 1..N on every page, the way a car stereo reuses its preset keys across
//! FM1/FM2/FM3. The pager walks one flattened space over every machine page
//! the store holds, home's slots first and then each attachment's, so the
//! same two keys are the band switch and the preset scroll. Stepping the
//! pager views a page without stealing the air: the channel on screen stays
//! put until a switch is pressed.
