//! Everything drawn after the chain: the casting, the furniture that stands
//! on it, and in time the badges over the glass.
//!
//! One pipeline, one instance buffer, one draw, one render pass with
//! `LoadOp::Load` scissored to the bank column, compositing straight onto the
//! swapchain view. The picture the chain finished is already on that image and
//! this goes over it; nothing here begins a pass with `Clear`, so there is no
//! offscreen texture and no copy back.
//!
//! # What each instance is
//!
//! A rectangle in **physical** pixels of the swapchain, a `kind` saying which
//! shader body draws it, and an index into that kind's parameter buffer. The
//! vertex stage places the rectangle and hands the fragment stage a `uv`
//! running 0..1 across it, so a body is written against its own piece rather
//! than against the window.
//!
//! Per-piece parameters ride in a storage buffer indexed by that index, which
//! is what makes one pass enough: nothing is written per draw, so nothing can
//! be overwritten by a later write in the same submission. A chain's uniform
//! buffer could not do that, and the mount that used one had to compile a
//! chain per distinct parameter set to work around it.
//!
//! One pass is also what keeps the bank's own order. The plan alternates
//! shaded pieces and drawn ones -- a row's moulding is struck over the
//! plate and under nothing, a strip's lamps sit inside the moulding -- so a
//! mount that drew all the shaded pieces and then all the drawn ones would
//! put a row's chrome over its own lit window. Every piece is an instance
//! here, in the plan's own order, and the draw is painter's order.
//!
//! # The vector half
//!
//! A piece of drawn furniture carries a [`chassis::paint::Painting`], a list
//! of operations rather than an image, and **each operation is its own
//! instance**: a rounded rectangle, a gradient, an arc, a filled path or a
//! line of text, in the order the painting lists them. The fixed-function
//! blender composites them source-over in that order, which is what one
//! accumulator used to do on the CPU, so a stack of half-transparent lips
//! still adds up the same way.
//!
//! Gradient stops and polygon points live in storage buffers of their own,
//! indexed per instance by an offset and a count, so a five-stop moulding
//! costs the instance nothing and quantises nothing.
//!
//! Text is the one thing still struck on the CPU, because a glyph outline is
//! not a shape the vector vocabulary can name. Each run goes through swash
//! once ([`chassis::paint::text_raster`]) and is packed into the same atlas
//! the display kits' rasters use. The cache is keyed on the run and the box
//! it is aligned in, both of which are measured in the painting's own
//! coordinates: a piece that moves keeps its numerals, so dragging the seam
//! re-strikes nothing.
//!
//! Compositing for text is single-alpha premultiplied, on a coverage that is
//! the largest of the three subpixel channels. Where a line lies on the plate
//! that is the result component-alpha reached anyway, since the seam that
//! carried the raster to the GPU had one alpha channel to put it in.
//!
//! # Which size is which
//!
//! Two sizes go in and they are deliberately different. The **rectangle** is
//! the bank column, in physical pixels, because it is a scissor and a quad.
//! The casting's `viewport_size` is the **screen well**, in logical pixels,
//! because the casting continues the bezel's metal field leftwards and is
//! drawn in the bezel's coordinates. The bezel reaches that same logical ruler
//! by dividing its own `OutputSize` by `windowScaling * DPR`
//! (`frame_metal.slang`'s `main`, and `crt::params::Params::build`);
//! [`well_ruler`] is this side of it.
//!
//! The two used to travel as one number each way round: a view declared at one
//! size while the quad covered another, in units that were physical
//! everywhere else in the mount. Here the well is a named field of the
//! parameter record and the rectangle is an instance attribute, so neither can
//! be read as the other.
