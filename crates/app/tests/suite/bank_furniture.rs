//! Done-test for the drawn furniture: what each piece of the bank actually
//! puts on the plate, read back off the GPU one piece at a time.
//!
//! The numerals, the mouldings, the pager keys, the screw heads, the
//! switchboard's lever and its tape well are descriptions
//! (`chassis::paint::Painting`), and a description is where a wrong colour, a
//! missing gradient or a dome that came out flat is invisible. So these read
//! pixels: one piece rendered on its own, over nothing, at the size its
//! rectangle asks for, through `app::chrome`'s pass and
//! `shaders/wgsl/vector.wgsl`.
//!
//! Over nothing is the point of the per-piece framing. The casting is left
//! out ([`Chrome::render`] takes `None` for it), so an alpha of zero means
//! the plate shows through there and the assertions can say "bare" and mean
//! it. Where a piece composites on the casting and on the pieces drawn ahead
//! of it, that is `bank_chrome.rs`'s business.
//!
//! Five of these are rules rather than pieces: the two gradient
//! orientations, the scale factor moving the geometry and not the colour, the
//! radial gradient at double scale, and a face the machine cannot supply.
//! They were arithmetic tests of a CPU rasteriser and are the same claims
//! about the shader that replaced it. The radial one is the sharp one: it
//! records a shipped bug where every screw dome came out flat on a HiDPI
//! screen, and the same bug is reachable in WGSL.
//!
//! One guarantee is not here and was given up with the CPU rasteriser: three
//! equal subpixel coverages compositing bit for bit as one grey coverage did.
//! Text now composites on a single alpha, the largest of its three channels.
