//! Input-method events, end to end into the child process.
//!
//! ## What this proves, and what it cannot
//!
//! It drives `Ime` values into the surface the binary runs and reads what the
//! child received. Everything on the rebuild's side of the input method is
//! therefore under test: the commit string becoming UTF-8 bytes, those bytes
//! reaching the PTY, the child's own echo coming back onto the screen, and the
//! pre-edit going nowhere near it.
//!
//! What it does **not** prove is that a real fcitx5 or ibus produces those
//! values on this machine. That round trip needs an X or Wayland server with an
//! input-method framework running, an engine selected, and keystrokes delivered
//! into a focused window -- none of which exists under Xvfb, and none of which
//! can be faked from inside the process, because the part being tested would be
//! the part doing the faking. The events here are synthesised, and the honest
//! reading of a green run is: *if* the platform delivers `Ime::Commit`, the
//! text lands in the child.
//!
//! Whether the platform delivers it is a hands-on check, and this is the whole
//! of it, so nobody has to reconstruct it later:
//!
//! 1. A desktop session with fcitx5 or ibus running and a CJK engine added,
//!    with `GTK_IM_MODULE` / `QT_IM_MODULE` / `XMODIFIERS` pointing at it.
//! 2. Run `robco-term`, focus the window, switch the input method on.
//! 3. Type `nihongo`, press space, press Enter. **Expected:** the romaji appear
//!    at the terminal cursor as a lit block with the letters struck into it (the
//!    pre-edit, drawn by `term::render::GridRenderer::set_preedit`), the
//!    candidate window sits at that same cursor (`set_ime_cursor_area`, from
//!    `TerminalSurface::ime_cursor_area`), and on Enter the composition vanishes
//!    and the chosen word appears in the shell, all at once.
//! 4. The failures that would mean this wiring is wrong: nothing appears on
//!    Enter (the events are not arriving -- look at `set_ime_allowed`); the
//!    romaji appear one character at a time *in the shell* rather than as a
//!    composition (the keystrokes are reaching `key_pressed` behind the input
//!    method's back); the composition draws but the candidate window still lands
//!    in a corner of the screen (the platform ignored the cursor area, or the
//!    rectangle is being computed from the wrong window -- it is in this
//!    window's physical pixels, bank column included); or the composition is
//!    left behind on the glass after a commit.
//!
//! Everything up to the framework is measured: the pre-edit's pixels in
//! `crates/term/tests/preedit.rs`, the caret rectangle below.
//!
//! Not run here, and not claimed here.
//!
//! Same harness as `keyboard_scroll.rs`: `TerminalSurface::headless` is the
//! surface with no swapchain, and `ime_input` is `Surface::ime` with winit's
//! own event dispatch peeled off.
