//! The channel bank end to end through the surface the binary runs: the keys
//! that open, close and choose a channel, the digit chords that name one, and
//! the transient the tube gives when the choice lands.
//!
//! `app::channels`, `app::chord` and `app::bank` each pin their own state
//! machine with no window and no pty. What none of them can say is that the
//! three are wired to each other and to a real session: that `Ctrl+Shift+T`
//! reaches the model rather than the keytab, that a chord's slot is resolved
//! against the page the bank is showing, and that a switch triggers the degauss
//! the frame samples. These drive the whole path.
//!
//! Same harness as `keyboard_scroll.rs`: `TerminalSurface::headless` is the
//! surface with no swapchain, and `key_input` is `key_pressed` with winit's own
//! `KeyEvent` peeled off (that type cannot be built outside winit). One
//! addition: the surface is given a cabinet, because the chord and the pager
//! live inside the bank, and a profile with no bank has neither.
