//! A shed write queue reaches the glass, not only the log.
//!
//! Both write queues are capped so a peer that stopped reading
//! cannot grow this process without bound. A cap that bites throws the user's
//! typing away, and before this test the whole of the evidence was a
//! `log::warn!`: keystrokes vanished and the screen said nothing about it. This
//! drives the real path -- a child that never reads its tty, a megabytes-long
//! paste at it, the surface's own pump -- and reads what the user would have
//! seen on the glass.
//!
//! The badge itself needs a device and a frame; `crates/app/tests/size_badge.rs`
//! is where its pixels are measured. What is measured here is the state under
//! it: `TerminalSurface::notice`, which is what the frame draws.
