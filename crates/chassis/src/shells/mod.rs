//! One module per shell:
//!
//! | module | appliance |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`annunciator`] | the amber appliance |
//! | [`slide_rule`] | the blue appliance |
//! | [`switchboard`] | the toggle-switch appliance |
//!
//! Each module holds two things for its shell:
//!
//! - **Metrics**: every fixed measure as a Rust constant. This is the
//!   geometry/layout contract the bank furniture (row furniture, pager,
//!   selector track, handled elsewhere) is built against; keeping it
//!   here regardless of which later consumer reads which field is what
//!   keeps the contract in one place per shell.
//! - **Chassis + frame**: the drawing recipe. Each region is painted with
//!   one of the three procedural metal shaders whose math lives in
//!   the `robco-shader-oracle` crate (`chassis_metal`, `plate_metal`, `frame_metal`). What
//!   differs shell to shell is which regions exist, their geometry, and the
//!   fixed parameters (colors, light direction, grain/mottle/scratch/vignette
//!   amounts) that shell chooses: held here as functions that build
//!   [`crate::params`]'s structs, so a done-test can hand them
//!   straight to the oracle (or to a real GPU render of the same preset).
//!
//! Two things every shell's chassis does identically, factored into
//! [`common`] rather than repeated three times: the frame-region field
//! mapping (viewport size / field scale / field offset) that lets the
//! chassis metal continue the frame's own procedural field, and the
//! frame's own viewport-size formula.
//!
//! Each module also holds its shell's **bank furniture** (row furniture,
//! pager, selector track, and where the shell has them the chassis screw
//! placements) as [`crate::paint::Painting`]s and, where a shell sinks a
//! `plate_metal` cap into one of them, as mixed piece lists.
//! [`row_furniture`], [`pager`], [`selector_track`] and [`screws`] below are
//! the per-shell dispatchers `crate::furniture` builds its plan from.
//!
//! Three pieces of canvas furniture stay out, each named where it would
//! have gone: the slide rule's rail groove and its hinge bracket's own
//! weathered plate body (the three screws bolted through it are painted, at
//! their own measured bank coordinates, [`slide_rule::screw_places`]), and
//! the switchboard's lever throw -- the lever itself is painted at rest,
//! only its swing and easing overshoot stay unbuilt
//! ([`switchboard::row_furniture`]).
