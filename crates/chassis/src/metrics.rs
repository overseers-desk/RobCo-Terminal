//! The two measure contracts the bank composes: what a shell declares about its
//! fixed furniture, and how a display quantises its own width. A shell's
//! measures are constants, so they are a plain struct; a display's are
//! functions of the live settings, so they are a trait a display kit
//! implements.
//!
//! A `ShellMetrics` value exists whole or not at all -- there is no
//! partial-load state to guard against. Two of its fields are real design
//! contract rather than defensive fallback, though: `top_padding`/
//! `bottom_padding` fall back to `bank_padding` when a shell splits nothing
//! evenly ([`ShellMetrics::new`]), and `track_x` falls back to `bank_padding`
//! for a shell whose chassis carries no rail ([`crate::bank::BankGeometry`]).
//!
//! # One home per measure group
//!
//! Three call sites once read each shell's or display's measures from three
//! sides and each kept its own answer (bare constants for the drawing
//! recipes, free functions for the strip raster, and a composed
//! struct/trait for the bank); a later unification collapsed that back to
//! one home per measure group, with this module holding only the *composed*
//! shape the bank reads:
//!
//! - a shell's metrics are owned by `crate::shells::{annunciator,
//!   slide_rule,switchboard}`'s `metrics` module -- bare constants, read
//!   directly by the drawing recipes beside them. [`shells::annunciator`]
//!   and its two siblings here build a [`ShellMetrics`] by reading those
//!   constants, not by restating them.
//! - a display's metrics are owned by `crate::displays::led::metrics` and
//!   `crate::displays::tape::metrics` -- free functions over the display's
//!   own settings-sourced parameters. [`LedMetrics`] and [`TapeMetrics`]'s
//!   [`DisplayMetrics`] impls call straight through to those functions with
//!   their own fields; the kits' free functions are the arithmetic, these
//!   impls are the swappable-at-runtime shape the bank, the seam drag and
//!   the strip raster all need `dyn DisplayMetrics` for.
//! - a shell's pager measures are a different concern, so they get a
//!   different home: `crate::shells::{annunciator,slide_rule,switchboard}`'s
//!   `pager` module, holding the three measures the bank's foot needs.
//!   [`ShellMetrics`]'s pager triple reads those, on the same terms as the
//!   `metrics` ones.
//!
//! `tests/metrics_homes.rs` pins each single home's composed shape against
//! its constants/functions as a regression check, so a shell or kit
//! silently regaining a second, drifting copy of its metrics would fail a
//! test rather than a code review.
