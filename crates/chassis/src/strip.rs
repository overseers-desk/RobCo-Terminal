//! The data seam between the channel model and the bank's furniture: what one
//! row of the bank shows, and what the whole visible page of rows shows.
//!
//! A row's whole contract with the model: the row reads nothing from the
//! model; the bank feeds it and takes the press back. The types here are
//! that feed, written down.
//!
//! # Who owns which half
//!
//! This module is **only** the shape. Nothing here reads a session, a page or a
//! channel: the channel model (`app::channels`, and the pager in `app::bank`)
//! fills these in, and the furniture (the shells' numerals, mouldings and the
//! LED/tape strips) draws from them. Neither side needs the other's code, which
//! is the point of putting the struct here: `chassis` is the crate both already
//! depend on.
//!
//! The measures a row is drawn at are *not* here either; they are
//! [`crate::BankGeometry`], which the same drawing code already has. A
//! [`StripRow`] carries what changes when a channel changes, and nothing that
//! changes when the window is resized.
//!
//! # How it reaches the display kits
//!
//! [`StripRow::open`] and [`StripRow::bright`] are exactly the `powered` and
//! `bright` a display item binds, so they go straight into
//! [`crate::displays::led::window_colors`] and
//! [`crate::displays::led::spill_strength`] / [`crate::displays::tape`]'s
//! `visible_text`. [`StripRow::title`] is the display's `text`.
