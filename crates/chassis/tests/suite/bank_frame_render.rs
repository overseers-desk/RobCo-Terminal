//! Done-test: the bank frame drawn, at sampled window sizes, with the uniforms
//! the geometry produces.
//!
//! `bank_frame_geometry.rs` proves the arithmetic. This proves the arithmetic
//! reaches the glass: the frame is rendered offscreen through `crt_burnin`'s
//! headless harness with the uniform set [`chassis::frame::frame_params`]
//! builds from a real [`WindowLayout`], and the screen opening it leaves is
//! measured off the readback and compared against what the distortion
//! formula says it should be.
//!
//! Why the opening is predictable without reimplementing the shader:
//!
//! - `frame_metal.frag`'s screen mask is a rounded-rect SDF over the *distorted*
//!   coordinates, taken against the unit rect (`oracle::frame_metal`, and
//!   `oracle::rounded_rect_sdf_pixels` under it). Outside that rect and away
//!   from a corner the SDF reduces to `(|local| - halfSize) - radius`, and
//!   `halfSize + radius` is exactly half the viewport, so the mask's zero
//!   crossing sits at distorted coordinate 0 whatever the corner radius is.
//! - `distortCoordinates` pads before it bends: `padded = coords * (1 + 2 *
//!   frameSize) - frameSize` (`oracle::distort_coordinates`). At zero curvature
//!   the bend is the identity, so the crossing lands at
//!   `frameSize / (1 + 2 * frameSize)` of the well's width -- the moulding's
//!   thickness, in one closed form, with no shader constants in it.
//!
//! So the measurement below reads the moulding off rendered pixels and checks
//! it against that expression, which carries `frameSize`, which carries the
//! screen scale, which carries the bank's width. A bank width that drifted, or
//! a derivation dropped between the stored setting and the uniform, moves this
//! edge.
