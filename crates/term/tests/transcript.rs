//! A scripted PTY transcript.
//!
//! Write bytes to a real shell, pump the read loop, read the grid back,
//! compare. The script runs straight through a resize and a DPR change
//! without restarting the session, because the point of the test is that
//! the session survives both: a half-applied resize (grid moved, child
//! not told) and a DPR change that never reaches the grid are the two
//! failures this test exists to prevent.
//!
//! No window and no threads. `Session::pump` is synchronous, so the test
//! drives the loop itself and the whole thing is an ordinary `cargo
//! test` on any machine, headless included.
