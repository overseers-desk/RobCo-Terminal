//! One line of antialiased text raster at a pixel size, with absolute
//! letter spacing and synthetic bold.
//!
//! The sibling of [`super::led`], and deliberately not the same function. The
//! LED strip's raster exists to feed a lamp grid, so it thresholds: every byte
//! is 0 or 255, one image pixel per font pixel, whatever the screen's scale
//! factor ([`super::led`]'s module doc has the reasoning). The chassis's
//! *plate* text is the opposite case. It is painted into the panel at device
//! resolution, antialiased, and the grey edges are the picture rather than a
//! defect in it: a struck numeral whose edges are hard reads as a stencil.
//!
//! So the two share [`super::raster::glyph_mask`] (the strike-first rule, one
//! home) and part company at the threshold.
//!
//! # What this text stack covers
//!
//! Only what the chassis furniture's text needs, which is a short list: one
//! line, one face, a pixel size, absolute letter spacing (pixels added to
//! every glyph's advance), a bold flag, and a horizontal alignment inside a
//! given width. There is no shaping, no bidi and no fallback: every string
//! painted through here is ASCII (`"01".."99"`, `"PREV"`, `"NEXT"`) or one
//! geometric arrow, and each is a single run in a single face.
//!
//! Geometry:
//!   * each glyph advances by its own fractional advance **plus the letter
//!     spacing**, added to every glyph including the last, so the spacing is
//!     in the line's natural width too;
//!   * width = round(that sum), floored at 1;
//!   * height = round(ascent) + round(descent), the implicit height a
//!     one-line raster reports;
//!   * baseline at round(ascent), glyphs placed at the truncated running pen.
//!
//! # Synthetic bold
//!
//! A bold request on a family with no bold face (which is every face this is
//! asked for, since the catalogue ships one weight each) is faked:
//! emboldening the *outline* by `units_per_EM / 24` and leaving the advance
//! alone, so a bold string occupies exactly the width the regular one did.
//! [`embolden`] is that, done to the coverage mask instead of the outline: a
//! horizontal max-filter of the same width. The stem thickens and the line
//! does not reflow, which is the behaviour that matters; the difference from
//! emboldening the curve is confined to the glyph's own antialiased edge.
//!
//! # Grey or subpixel
//!
//! Whether the coverage comes back as one value per pixel or three is not
//! this module's decision: it is the host's, read out of fontconfig by
//! [`super::subpixel`], which also owns the filter. Everything about the
//! *line* is the same either way -- the advances, the width an alignment is
//! measured against, the raster's bounds, the baseline -- because an LCD
//! sampling mode changes how a glyph is sampled inside its pixels and nothing
//! about where those pixels are. That is why the layout below runs once and
//! the choice appears only in how wide the sample buffer is.
