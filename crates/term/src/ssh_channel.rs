//! The session variant an SSH channel feeds: remote bytes in, keystrokes
//! straight to the wire.
//!
//! Where [`super::session::Session`] owns a PTY and [`super::tmux_pane::TmuxPane`]
//! owns nothing but a screen, this variant owns a wire it can speak to.
//! That puts it on the PTY session's side of every seam the two differ on:
//! its bytes are its own (drained here, not routed by a gateway), its
//! writes name their destination (no queue-and-drain), its resize has a far
//! half (`window_change` where the PTY does `TIOCSWINSZ`), and its end is
//! session state (the wire's `Eof`, where a pane waits on a model
//! transition).
//!
//! The wire itself stays behind [`SshWire`], a trait with no SSH types in
//! it, so this crate compiles with no transport, no runtime and no crypto
//! under it: tests feed a `Vec`-backed fake, the app hands in the real
//! adapter, and the parser cannot tell them apart.
//!
//! The DCS tap is here from the start, not deferred: a `tmux -CC` typed on
//! a remote shell must be detectable exactly as on a local one, and the
//! tap at ground state is a byte-scan no-op.
