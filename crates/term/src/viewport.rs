//! Scrollback viewport.
//!
//! rio-vt owns the authoritative line count (`Grid::display_offset`, in
//! whole lines above the bottom), and `Line` indexing folds it in, so this
//! type is not a second copy of that state. It is the policy layer: how a
//! wheel notch, a touchpad's pixels or a Shift-PageUp turn into a position,
//! whether the view follows new output, and the one thing rio-vt cannot
//! hold, a position between two lines.
//!
//! The position is [`ScrollPosition::pos`], rows above the bottom as a
//! float (VTE keeps the same number as `scroll_delta`). rio-vt's offset is
//! held at `ceil(pos)`, and the remainder `ceil(pos) - pos` is the
//! [`shift`](ScrollPosition::shift): the fraction of a row the picture is
//! drawn shifted *up*, with one spare row filled below the last. Ceil rather
//! than floor, because `display_offset == 0` is rio-vt's own definition of
//! "live": with the offset at 0 nothing holds the view against output
//! arriving, and under floor a position of 0.3 rows would leave it there,
//! so the first line of output would yank the picture a whole row in the
//! middle of a gesture. Under ceil any position above 0 pins the view at
//! once; the picture is continuous at 0 (a position of 0.001 is offset 1
//! drawn shifted up by 0.999 of a row, the same pixels as offset 0); and
//! every row index the renderer and the damage path use keeps its meaning.
//!
//! The rule that matters to the renderer is the last one: a viewport that
//! moved by a line invalidates every row on screen, because rio-vt's own
//! damage is expressed in viewport coordinates and says nothing about the
//! rows that scrolled in from history. A change of shift alone moves the
//! picture, not the rows, and invalidates nothing.
