//! The grid seam, and the two grid-to-text paths every consumer above it uses.
//!
//! Selection, search and the URL filters all work on text, and all three
//! reach it through the same pair of functions: one that copies a line (or
//! part of one, clamped to the cells that were actually written) and one
//! that decodes cells into text (dropping the second half of every
//! double-width character). Sharing them means the three consumers share one
//! definition of "what does this line say".
//!
//! Everything above this module addresses lines by **absolute index**: 0 is
//! the oldest line still in scrollback and `total_lines() - 1` is the bottom
//! of the screen — a single linear index over history and screen together,
//! matching how Konsole numbers lines. It is also rio-vt's, shifted: rio-vt's
//! `Line` is signed with 0 at the top of the screen, so
//! `absolute = line + history_lines()`.
